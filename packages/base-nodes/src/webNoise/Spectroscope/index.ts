    "Real-time frequency spectrum analyzer that visualizes audio frequency content using FFT analysis. Essential for understanding harmonic structure, identifying frequencies, and monitoring spectral balance in mixing and sound design.",
  info: `# Spectroscope (Frequency Analyzer)

A real-time frequency spectrum analyzer that uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to visualize the frequency content of audio signals. The spectroscope provides detailed insight into harmonic structure, overtones, and spectral characteristics.

## Purpose

- Visualize frequency content and harmonic structure of audio signals
- Identify fundamental frequencies and overtones in musical material
- Monitor spectral balance during mixing and mastering
- Analyze resonances and problem frequencies in sound design
- Educational tool for understanding frequency relationships and harmonics

The spectroscope is a non-destructive analysis toolâ€”it does not modify the audio signal and has no audio output.`,
